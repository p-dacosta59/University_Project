<h1>The Autonomous Car</h1/>

The project consisted in creating a fully autonomous car. It was able to follow a predefined circuit while avoiding placed objects. 
We have developed a website allowing the user to place the route of the car, to place prohibition tags and positioning tags allowing the 
triangularization of the car. 
The car had to establish the shortest possible path while dodging obstacles.It had to locate by itself with its infra-red receiver.
